Examples
=====

These examples show how to embed civetweb into a C ([embedded_c](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/master/examples/embedded_c)) or a C++ ([embedded_cpp](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/master/examples/embedded_cpp)) application.
The C++ wrapper only offers a subset of the full C API, thus the C example is more complete than the C++ example.

In addition, there is one example how to configure a HTTPS server, to comply with modern security standards ([https](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/master/examples/https)). It does not hold any source, but only a configuration file and some documentation how to use it.

Some no longer maintained examples can be found in the ["obsolete"](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/tree/master/examples/_obsolete) folder. It is not guaranteed that they work in the current version - they are kept for reference, but might be removed in the future.

All examples are subject to the MIT license (unless noted otherwise) - it comes without warranty of any kind.
